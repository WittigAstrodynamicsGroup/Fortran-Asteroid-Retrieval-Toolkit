QUICK STUFF

Within Matlab, run_me.m is a script which performs an example 
calculation of a family of periodic orbits (po's) around a
saddle x center equilibrium point in the planar circular
restricted three-body problem (pcr3bp).  The equil. point is on
the x-axis.  To run the routine, just run from Matlab,

>> run_me

The routine plots the family of orbits after it computes them. 
Also plots one branch of unstable manifold for the largest orbit in the family.


THE FUNCTIONS

This package is an example package which will need modification
for your problem of interest.  As of now, it is configured for the
three-body problem, thus the 3BP appearing in the file names.  From
Matlab you can get descriptions of most of the functions, e.g.,

>> help poGuessLinear3BP

will give you a description of the inputs and outputs of this function.

In what follows, the functions called in run_me.m are briefly described.  
You will need to look at the functions themselves and modify them.  
Hopefully there are enough comments within the files themselves that you 
can do this easily.  Subfunctions used by other functions are indented
below the function which calls them.

poFamGet3BP - Generate a family of periodic orbits given a pair of
	seed initial conditions and periods of two small po's

  poGuessLinear3BP - provides an initial guess for an initial condition
	along a periodic orbit (po) as well as a guess for the period

    eqPointLoc3BP - provides the position space location of the equilibrium
	point (ep) around which the po is to be computed.  This is done
	by solving a polynomial arising from setting the vector field to 
	zero (equivalently, the critical points of the effective potential)

      gamma3BP - a function used by eqPointLoc3BP

    eqPointEig3BP - provides the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of 
	Jacobian of the vector field at the ep

      eigGet - Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Jacobian 
 	matrix A spanning the three local subspaces <Es,Eu,Ec>
  
        cleanUpMatrix - used by eigGet, it removes all entries in matrix A
	with absolute value smaller than a set tolerance

  poDifCor3BP - This is the differential correction routine to create a
	periodic orbit (po) about an equilibrium point. Keeps the initial  
	x-value constant and varies the y-velocity value.  It starts from
	the initial guess provided by poGuessLinear3BP.  It usually 
	converges to an accurate solution within a few iterations for 
	this example problem.
 
  poManiLocal3BP - Computes (un)stable manifold for a periodic
	orbit (of period T) from eigenvalues of the monodromy PHI(T,0) 
	matrix

    pcr3bp - the vector field of the pcr3bp, 4 first order ODEs

    stateTransitionMatrix3BP - Gets state transition matrix, phi_tf =
	PHI(0,tf), and the trajectory (x,t) for a length of time, tf.

      varEqs3BP - the variational equations used to get the state transition
	matrix; these are 16+4=20 first order ODEs

trajGet3BP - this routine finds solutions of the vector field given an
	initial condition, starting time and ending time
