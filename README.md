# Asteroid Retrieval - Refactors ongoing

Global repository for all asteroid retrieval-related codes. The following sub-folders exist:

---

* `asteroid_optimiser`: Codes required to optimise the condition of one asteroid; main codes used to optimise these asteroids.
* `orbit_construction`: MATLAB routines used to generate orbits in the CR3BP. Not refactored.
* `pre_filter`: Contains all files necessary to perform the pre-filtering routines for *one* asteroid in the database. Some versions of the code have been parallelized, either using shared memory paradigms or by GPU computing. These versions are as yet untested.
